# DWIN_ESP32

⚠️ Note: The project is still in developement phase ⚠️

Please follow [wiki](https://github.com/MadRajib/DWIN_ESP32/wiki) for documentation.
 
This is my take on building a klipper screen like solution
using my old thrown away Ender3v2 display using ESP32.

My Goal here is to control thr graphics of display using ESP32
with the fetched print stats from the printer.
